# NFT Collection
 
  ~There should only exist 20 NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
  
  ~User's should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
  
  ~Whitelisted users, should have a 5 min presale period before the actual sale where they are guaranteed 1 NFT per transaction.
  
  ~There should be a website for your NFT Collection.
  
  
 ## Tech Stack
 
   ~In this project I used Hardhat for an Ethereum development environment and framework.  I go on to use React a javascript framework used to make websites and Next.js      is a React framework that also allows writing backend APIs code along with the frontend, so you don't need two separate frontend and backend services.
   
   ~The smart contract itself was written in Solidity language utilizing ethers.js which is a library that aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with    the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem
  
   ~Web3Modal library. Web3Modal is an easy to use library to help developers easily allow their users to connect to your dApps with all sorts of different wallets. By      default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc) and WalletConnect
  
  ### Overview/Notes
  
  The project came together flawlessly as a NFT Collection with only 20 unique NFT's.  Prefence is given to Whitelisted Wallets to purchase 1 NFT for 
  5 minute presale period. I added my personal touch when it came to bulding the frontend HTML & CSS a modification on the LW3 Design.
